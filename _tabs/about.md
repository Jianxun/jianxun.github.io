I am **Jianxun Zhu**, an electrical engineer with a Ph.D. from Columbia University.  
My expertise is in **analog, RF, and mixed-signal IC design**, and my research focuses on building new paradigms for circuit design in the age of AI.

## Research Focus

I am developing the **Analog Structural Design Language (ASDL)** — a representation for analog circuits that captures hierarchy, design intent, and portability.  
My broader goal is to create an **open-source, AI-augmented analog design ecosystem**, including:

- **ASDL & Compiler** – a technology-agnostic IR for analog circuits.  
- **Rosetta Dataset** – a large-scale analog circuit dataset.  
- **simorc** – a simulation orchestrator for testbenches and regression.  
- **MOSbius** – an educational chip platform with Prof. Peter Kinget.
